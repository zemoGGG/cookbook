difficulty: 3/5
prepTime: 50 minutes
cookTime: 90 minutes
servings: 8
specialty: false
ingredients:
- Russet Potatoes (4lb, washed and unpeeled)
- Onion (1/2, finely minced)
- Garlic (3 cloves, minced/pressed)
- Gruyère Cheese (1 1/2 cup, shredded)
- Cheddar CHeese (1 1/2 cup, shredded)
- Parmesan (3/4 cup, grated)
- Thyme (1 tbsp, chopped)
- Heavy Cream (2 cups)
- Bay Leaves (3)

steps:
- Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook for 25-30 minutes, removing when still not quite tender. Drain and set aside until they are cool enough to handle (10-15 min).
- In a small skillet, melt 1 tbsp butter over medium heat. Add onion and cook until transluscent and tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook for an additional 3 minutes. Transfer everything to a medium bowl and let cool.
- Preheat oven to 350F. Grease a 9x13 baking dish.
- Add Gruyère, Cheddar, Parmesan, Thyme, and 2 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper to the bowl with the onion/garlic mixture. Mix until well combined.
- Peel and slice potatoes 1/4" thick. Arrange 1/3 of the potatoes in the baking dish, overlapping when necessary. Sprinkle 1/3 of the cheese mixture, and continue with two more layers. Top with the remaining cheese. Pour the cream over the top of the potatoes and add bay leaves.
- Bake until cream is mostly absorbed and the cheese on top is golden brown and bubbling, about 1 hour 15 minutes.
- Let cool for 10 minutes, remove bay leaves, and serve.
