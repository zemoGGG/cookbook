difficulty: 3/5
prepTime: 15 minutes
cookTime: 75 minutes
servings: 6
specialty: false
ingredients:
- Top Round/Sirloin Roast (3-4 lbs)
- Beef Stock (2 qt)
- Celery (3 stalks, roughly chopped)
- Carrots (4, roughly chopped)
- Onions (2, roughly chopped)
- Oregano (2 tbsp, dried)
- Garlic Powder (1 tbsp)
- Onion Powder (1 tbsp)
- Dried Basil (1 tbsp)
- Red Pepper Flakes (1/2 tbsp)
- Black Pepper (1 tbsp)
- Kosher Salt (1/4 cup)
- Beef Better Than Bouillon

steps:
- Preheat a dutch oven over medium-high heat. Preheat oven to 350F.
- Season the roast with salt and pepper. Add 2 tbsp of neutral oil to the dutch oven, and sear the meat on all sides until browned.
- Remove beef, deglaze with the celery, carrots, and onions using a wooden spoon.
- Once all the fond is up from the bottom of the dutch oven, add the beef stock.
- Add dry spices, Better Than Bouillon, and mix together. Add the beef back to the pot.
- Cover and cook in the oven until the beef reaches an internal temperature of 122F (it will rise ~10F during its resting). This could take anywhere from 30-60 minutes depending on the size of your roast.
- Run the broth through a strainer to remove all the solids. Taste for seasoning (Since this will be the broth we are dipping our sandwiches in, it should be really salty. If you taste it and you don't consider it to be salty, **add more salt**.)
- Once beef has cooled, slice thinly with a deli slicer or a sharp carving knife.
- Heat the stock over medium heat. Once hot, add the beef into the pot with the broth.
- Slice a sandwich roll in half, fill with beef straight from the pot, and top with giardiniera. Serve with a side of broth, if desired.
