image: /recipes/images/beefbarley.webp
difficulty: 2/5
prepTime: 20 minutes
cookTime: 60 minutes
servings: 6
ingredients:
- London Broil/Chuck Roast (1-2 lbs, 1/2 in cubes)
- Olive Oil (3 tbsp)
- Carrots (3, chopped)
- Celery (2 stalks, chopped)
- Onion (1, minced)
- Tomato Paste (3 tbsp)
- Garlic (4 cloves, minced)
- Chicken/Beef Broth (64 oz)
- Soy Sauce (1 tbsp)
- Worcestershire Sauce (2 tsp)
- Rosemary (2 tsp fresh / 1/2 tsp dried, minced)
- Thyme (2 tsp fresh / 1/2 tsp dried, minced)
- Pearl Barley (2/3 cup)
- Potatoes (3-4, bite-size pieces)
- Parsley (fresh, to garnish)

steps:
- Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Season the meat with pepper and add it to the hot pan (adding salt will draw out moisture, leading to it steaming instead of browning)
- Sear until golden brown on all sides, and set aside with juices in a bowl. Add 1 tbsp olive oil to the pot, and add the carrots, celery, and onions. Saute 3 minutes.
- Add tomato paste and garlic, and saute for 30 seconds. Add broth, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper. Add beef back, simmer for 40 minutes.
- After 30 minutes of simmering, start peeling and dicing the potatoes. Add them to the pot and cook until fork tender.
- Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately with fresh parsley.
