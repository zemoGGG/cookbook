description: A classic Japanese curry with tender meat and vegetables, served over white rice.
difficulty: 2/5
prepTime: 20 minutes
cookTime: 60 minutes
servings: 4
specialty: true
ingredients:
- Onions
- Carrots
- Gold Potatoes
- Ginger
- Garlic
- Protein (Chuck Roast, Chicken thighs, Pork cutlet)
- Black pepper
- Neutral Oil
- Broth
- Soy Sauce
- Worcestershire Sauce
- Curry Roux Box
- White Rice (for serving)
steps:
- Mince onions or cut into wedges. Peel carrots and cut at a 45-degree angle, rotating a quarter turn with each cut. Peel potatoes, cut into quarters. Soak potato pieces in water to prevent browning.
- Grate fresh ginger. Mince or grate garlic.
- Cut your protein of choice into small pieces (1-inch pieces for chuck roast, bite size for chicken thigh).
- Heat oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown your meat on all sides until a decent amount of fond is on the bottom. Remove meat.
- Lower heat to medium, and add a few fresh tablespoons of oil. Saute onions for 3-4 minutes until soft and transluscent. Add garlic and ginger, cook until fragrant. Add meat back to the pot.
- Add in broth, soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, black pepper, and any additional condiments you desire.
- Add carrots. If using beef, bring to a boil and simmer for an hour before continuing to let the meat properly cook. After 15 minutes of simmering, add potatoes and continue to simmer for another 15 minutes.
- Remove from heat. Add curry roux blocks one at a time, making sure they are fully incorporated before adding the next.
- If necessary, put back on heat and simmer until sauce thickens. Taste and adjust seasoning.
