- Transfer to a wire rack and continue with the remaining cutlets.<br><br>

- Spread a spoonful of marinara sauce over each cutlet.
- Place 1 slice of provolone and 2-3 slices of mozzarella on each cutlet.
- Sprinkle with grated parmesan.<br><br>

- Place cutlets under a broiler set to high for 2-3 minutes (or convection bake at 450F for 6-8 minutes).
