steps:
- "**MARINADE**"
- Beat egg whites in a large bowl until lightly foamy. Add soy sauce, wine, and vodka. Whisk to combine.
- Pour half of the mixture into a small bowl to use for the dry coat later.
- Add cornstarch and baking soda to the large bowl, and whisk to combine.
- Add chicken pieces, and use your hands to coat thoroughly. Cover with plastic and set aside.<br><br>

- "**DRY COAT**"
- Combine flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk to combine.
- Add the reserved marinadem ixture, and whisk until clumps are formed. These will make your chicken extra crispy when frying.<br><br>

- "**SAUCE**"
- Combine sugar, chicken stock, soy sauce, wine, vinegar, cornstarch, and sesame oil in a small bowl. Stir with a fork until everything is dissolved and no lumps remain.<br><br>

- "**FRYING CHICKEN**"
- Heat oil in a large wok or Dutch oven to 350°F.
- Working one piece at a time, transfer chicken to the dry coat, tossing in between to completely coat chicken.
- Once all pieces are added, toss and press the mixture into the chicken with your hands so it adheres. Make sure each piece is coated thoroughly.
- Once piece at a time, shake off excess coating and add to the hot oil. 
- Once all the oil is added, agitate with a metal spider so the pieces don't stick together.
- Maintaining an oil temperature around 350°F, cook until chicken is cooked through and very crispy.
- Transfer to a paper towel-lined bowl to drain.<br><br>

- "**FINISHING**"
- Combine oil, garlic, ginger, and red chiles in a wok or large skillet and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently until vegetables are aromatic but not browned.
- Stir the sauce mixture and add to the wok. Stir until the sauce boils and thickens, around 1 minute. Add scallion segments to the wok.
- Add chicken and toss until all pieces are thoroughly coated.
- Serve immediately with white rice.
