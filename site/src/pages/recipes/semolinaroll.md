cookTime: 30 minutes
servings: 3
specialty: false
ingredients:
- Bread Flour (240g)
- Semolina Flour (160g)
- Sugar (13g)
- Instant Dry Yeast (10g)
- Olive Oil (14g)
- Salt (9g)
- Water (227g, 90F)
- Sesame Seeds, *optional*

steps:
- Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the dough hook, mix on speed 2 for 8 minutes, or until the dough is pulling away from the bowl.
- Turn the dough out onto a lighly oiled surface, and knead with your hands until the dough turns smooth, ~2 minutes. Shape it into a ball and place in a lightly oiled bowl. Set in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours.
- After the dough has almost doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured or oiled surface. Divide into three equal pieces.
- Press each piece of dough into a rectangle about 11" in length and 3" wide. Roll the rectangle from one long side to the other. Make sure the seam is shut tightly. Roll the log again and taper each end.
- "*Optionally*, sprinkle sesame seeds on a sheet tray and roll each dough log through the seeds."
- Place each dough log onto a parchment-lined sheet tray with seam side down.
- Flatten each dough log with your fingers slighly so it doesn't rise into a cylinder.
- Cover with a lighly oiled piece of plastic wrap and place in a warm area for 1 hour.
- Preheat oven to 375F.
- "*Optionally, but recommended,* Score each roll with a bread lame from end to end."
- Bake for 25-30 minutes, rotating the pan 180 degrees halfway through. They should be a light golden brown when they're done.
- Allow to cool before slicing. Use to make a <a href='../recipes/italianbeef'>sandwich</a>.
