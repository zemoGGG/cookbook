image: /recipes/images/rolls.png
difficulty: 4/5
prepTime: 240 minutes
cookTime: 30 minutes
servings: 9 rolls
ingredients:
- "**TANGZHONG**"
- Bread Flour (20g)
- Water (27g)
- Whole Milk (60g)<br><br>

- "**BREAD DOUGH**"
- Bread Flour (320g)
- Active/Instant Yeast (9g)
- Kosher Salt (3g)
- Whole Milk (120g)
- Sugar (56g)
- Butter (3 tbsp, softened)
- Egg (1, room temperature)<br><br>

- "**EGG WASH**"
- Egg (1)
- Milk (1 tbsp)<br><br>

- "**GARLIC BUTTER**"
- Garlic (1-2 cloves, minced)
- Butter (4 tbsp)

steps:
- Combine all tangzhong ingredients together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Constantly whisk together until it becomes a paste. If you do not constantly whisk, it will stick and burn.
- Once it is thickened into a paste, remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.
- In the bowl of a stand mixer, add the flour, yeast, salt, and sugar. Add in the milk, tangzhong mixture, and a whole egg. Mix on low speed until a loose dough ball comes together.
- When a ball forms, turn up the speed to medium low. Add the softened butter one tablespoon at a time, waiting until it is fully incorporated before adding the next. This should take 5-7 minutes.
- Once all the butter is added and nothing is sticking to the sides, dump the dough onto a clean work surface and roll into a tight ball.
- Place the dough into a large, lightly oiled bowl, and cover with a damp towel. Allow to rise at room temperatue until doubled in size, 1-2 hours.
- Punch down the dough, and dump onto a lightly floured work surface. Divide into 9 equal pieces, around 75g each.
- Oil a 9x9 baking dish. Roll each dough piece into small, tight balls, and place into the baking dish in rows of 3.
- Cover with a damp towel and allow to rise for 1-2 hours.
- 30 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 350F.
- Make the egg wash, and brush on top of the rolls. Bake in the preheated oven for 28-30 minutes.
- While the rolls are baking, add the minced garlic and butter to a cold, small saucepan and turn on over medium heat.
- Sweat the garlic for 30 seconds until lightly cooked, and immediately remove from the heat.
- Once rolls are golden brown, remove from oven and immediately brush with garlic salt and top with a pinch of flakey salt.
